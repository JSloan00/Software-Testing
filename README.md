# Software-Testing
# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By using JUnit testing, I was able to ensure that my program was functional and secure. JUnit testing allows the developer to view the coverage percentages which ensure that each part of the code is used properly and securely. After performing the JUnit tests, I made sure that each coverage percentage was at least 85%. It was also very important to follow the client's requirements and review the code before finalizing the project. 
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By gathering the requirements from the client, I should be able to develop a good understanding of the user needs. By following all requirements, the user's needs should naturally be incorporated into the program. It would also be beneficial to execute the code and test it to ensure all needs are met. 
# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first gathering and analyzing the requirements. I will then begin developing the program by working in parts, depending on the project's requirements. For each part, I will stop and execute/test the code to ensure it is working properly and make any changes necessary before moving to the next part. Learning about JUnit testing is new to me, so I will be using this in future projects to test my code.
